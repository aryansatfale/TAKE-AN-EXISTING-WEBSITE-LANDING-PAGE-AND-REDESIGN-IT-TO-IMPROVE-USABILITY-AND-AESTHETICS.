**DESCRIPTION**: My first task was 'TAKE AN EXISTING WEBSITE LANDING PAGE AND REDESIGN IT TO IMPROVE USABILITY AND AESTHETICS'.So, I took 'UBER' website landing page and tried to redesign it.I opened Figma, I started by creating a new frame. I selected a desktop screen size (1440x1024 px) to ensure the design looked optimal on larger screens.For the header, I included Uber’s logo prominently on the top left, followed by the main navigation options: Ride, Drive, Business, About, Log In, and Sign In.Then I wrote tagline "Ride Smarter with Uber." I chose a bold font and placed it against a gradient or subtle background to make it stand out. Below this, I included a minimalistic input form for users to enter their pickup and drop-off locations, along with a "See Prices" button.I used Uber’s signature black, white, and gray color palette, with occasional splashes of green for buttons to guide user actions. Using Figma community, I created smooth icons and placeholders to depict “Ride” and “Courier” options.These is how I made my UBER landing page in figma.
